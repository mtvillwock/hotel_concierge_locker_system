# Hotel Locker System

Functionality:
- user can add a bag to a locker and get a ticket
- user can enter a bag id from their ticket to retrieve their bag from the locker

## Assumptions
The scope and scale of this challenge was loosely defined. I chose to build the program as a Rails app because I felt that it would work well and be more useful to the end user.

I felt that tickets, lockers, and bags were the central focus of the operation. For future iterations, I could add other facets like employees, hotels, and customers. For example, adding a user class would allow various levels of authentication for hotel operations depending on which level of employee was logged in.

This was a really fun challenge to work on. It required a great deal of thought and great opportunity to address a real-world issue with my code.
